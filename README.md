# [Silence and Suspend list for im-in.space](https://github.com/im-in-space/blocking-list)
This is a list of instances and users that are silenced/suspended on [im-in.space](https://im-in.space/).  
This is inspired by the work of [Toot CafÃ©](https://github.com/tootcafe/blocked-on-mastodon), [Cybrespace](https://cybre.space/users/chr/updates/2616) and [MastocafÃ©](https://social.wxcafe.net/users/wxcafe/updates/2651).

> **Silence** a user or instance is making sure they don't appear in public timelines. You can still follow them.  
> **Suspending** a user or instance means we wont federate at all with them. You can't follow them.  
> **Rejecting media** means we won't save a copy of their pictures or videos on our server. Some 3rd party apps might break with this since the media is missing.
